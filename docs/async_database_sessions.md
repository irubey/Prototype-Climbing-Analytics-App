# Async Database Sessions PRD

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the migration to a fully asynchronous database access layer using SQLAlchemy's `AsyncSession`. By eliminating synchronous calls, integrating an asynchronous driver (such as **asyncpg** for PostgreSQL), and updating all data access patterns to use `async/await`, we ensure that our application is optimized for high-concurrency and non-blocking I/O, resulting in improved performance and scalability under load.

## 2. Scope and Objectives

This migration affects the entire database access layer and requires all components—API endpoints, services, background tasks, and tests—to interact exclusively through asynchronous sessions. The main objectives are:

- Eliminate all synchronous database calls in favor of async operations.
- Configure the asynchronous engine using `create_async_engine` with the appropriate async driver.
- Implement a unified asynchronous session factory (`AsyncSessionLocal`) via `async_sessionmaker`.
- Update dependency injections to yield only asynchronous sessions through functions such as `get_async_db()`.
- Update code paths throughout the codebase to exclusively use asynchronous data fetching and committing with proper non-blocking patterns.

## 3. Functional Requirements

The targeted migration involves a full transition to asynchronous database sessions. Specific requirements include:

- Configuring an asynchronous engine using `create_async_engine` (with an async driver like **asyncpg**).
- Implementing an asynchronous session factory that replaces any legacy synchronous session handling.
- Ensuring that all database interactions (queries, transactions, etc.) leverage `await` within an async context.
- Updating all dependencies, routes, and services so they exclusively use the async session via the `get_async_db()` dependency.
- Guaranteeing proper resource cleanup using `async with` to enforce non-blocking session management.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

The asynchronous migration must guarantee:

- **Low Latency:** Non-blocking database queries that support high levels of concurrency.
- **Scalability:** Improved throughput under concurrent loads with efficient connection pooling.
- **Maintainability:** A simplified and uniform codebase where all database interactions are async.
- **Testability:** The ability to write asynchronous unit and integration tests to validate database operations.
- **Backward Compatibility:** While transitioning, all components must be reviewed and updated; legacy synchronous code must be entirely removed.

## 5. Architecture and Design Decisions

This migration enforces a single, fully asynchronous approach for all database interactions. In the redesigned `app_fastapi/db/session.py`, only an asynchronous engine and session factory are defined, eliminating any synchronous code. This centralization reduces complexity and the risk of inadvertently blocking the event loop.

Below is the new implementation example:

```python:app_fastapi/db/session.py
from typing import AsyncGenerator
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, async_sessionmaker, create_async_engine
from app_fastapi.core.config import settings

# Create an asynchronous engine using the asyncpg driver for PostgreSQL
async_engine = create_async_engine(
    settings.DATABASE_URI.replace("postgresql://", "postgresql+asyncpg://"),
    pool_size=5,
    max_overflow=10,
    pool_timeout=30,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    echo=settings.FLASK_ENV == "development"
)

# Configure the asynchronous session factory
AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(
    async_engine,
    autocommit=False,
    autoflush=False,
    expire_on_commit=False
)

async def get_async_db() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    """
    Get asynchronous database session.
    To be used with FastAPI's dependency injection system.
    """
    async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:
        try:
            yield session
        finally:
            await session.close()
```

The ORM model registration in `app_fastapi/db/base.py` and the shared model functionality in `app_fastapi/db/base_class.py` remain unchanged, ensuring a seamless migration of all models to interact with the new asynchronous session.

## 6. Implementation Plan

The migration will occur in four phases:

**Phase 1: Setup and Configuration**

- Remove all synchronous database session factories.
- Implement and test the asynchronous engine and session factory.
- Update dependency injection to exclusively provide asynchronous sessions using `get_async_db()`.

**Phase 2: Codebase Migration**

- Refactor all API endpoints, service functions, and background tasks that perform database operations to use async methods (e.g., replace `db.execute(...)` with `await db.execute(...)` and `db.commit()` with `await db.commit()`).
- Remove all synchronous database calls from the codebase.

**Phase 3: Testing and Validation**

- Develop and run asynchronous unit and integration tests to ensure correct behavior of all database interactions.
- Conduct performance benchmarks to validate reduced latency and improved throughput.
- Perform code audits to verify the absence of blocking database calls.

**Phase 4: Documentation and Rollback**

- Update developer documentation and migration guides to reflect the new async-only approach.
- Prepare rollback procedures by maintaining versioned backups until the asynchronous implementation is confirmed stable.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria and Rollback

The migration is deemed successful if:

- All database interactions are conducted exclusively through asynchronous sessions (using `await`).
- No blocking calls occur in any database operations.
- Automated tests for asynchronous operations pass consistently.
- Performance benchmarks demonstrate improved concurrency and reduced latency.
- A rollback strategy is defined (e.g., using version control to revert changes) in the unlikely event that issues arise post-deployment.

## 8. Risks and Mitigation

Potential risks include:

- Inadvertent retention of synchronous code leading to blocking behavior.
- Compatibility issues with third-party libraries that may not fully support async operations.
- Increased complexity in debugging asynchronous code.
  Mitigation strategies include comprehensive code reviews, rigorous testing (including stress tests in staging), and ensuring all dependencies are async-compatible.

## 9. Summary

This PRD mandates a complete migration to asynchronous database sessions using `AsyncSession` and an async driver. By transitioning entirely from synchronous calls, the application will better support high-concurrency workloads and enhance overall performance. All modifications are aligned with best practices for asynchronous programming, and thorough testing will validate the new system before decommissioning any legacy synchronous code.
