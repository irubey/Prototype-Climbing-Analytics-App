# Migration Roadmap Overview

This document outlines the recommended roadmap for our system refactoring initiative. The migration is divided into three primary domains, each containing specific PRDs that should be accomplished sequentially.

## 1. Architectural Changes

### 1.1 Migrate from Flask to FastAPI

- Convert Flask's synchronous routes to FastAPI's asynchronous APIRouters
- Implement dependency injection patterns
- Integrate Jinja2 templates with FastAPI

### 1.2 Make Database Sessions Asynchronous

- Transition to SQLAlchemy AsyncSessions
- Implement asyncpg driver integration
- Update data access patterns for async operations

### 1.3 Transition Server from Gunicorn to ASGI

- Replace WSGI server (Gunicorn) with ASGI server
- Options include Uvicorn or Hypercorn
- Ensure full async operation support

## 2. Authentication Changes

### 2.1 Implement OAuth2/JWT Login Flow

- Develop new authentication endpoints
- Implement JWT token generation
- Integrate OAuth2 authentication flow

### 2.2 Secure Endpoints Using Dependency Injection

- Develop `get_current_user` dependency
- Implement JWT validation and parsing
- Secure API endpoints throughout application

### 2.3 Token Lifecycle Management

- Define token refresh strategy
- Implement revocation mechanisms
- Establish key rotation protocols

## 3. CSS Changes (Tailwind Migration)

### 3.1 Tailwind Environment Setup

- Configure PostCSS and Autoprefixer
- Set up package.json dependencies
- Integrate compiled CSS with Jinja2 templates

### 3.2 Design Token Mapping

- Migrate existing design tokens to Tailwind
- Customize tailwind.config.js
- Establish centralized design language

### 3.3 UI Component Migration

- Incrementally refactor Jinja templates
- Replace legacy CSS classes with Tailwind utilities
- Prioritize high-impact components

### 3.4 Legacy CSS Retirement

- Phase out deprecated CSS files
- Implement PurgeCSS optimization
- Optimize production bundle

**Note**: This sequence ensures incremental migration and testing of each system component, facilitating a smooth transition to a scalable and maintainable application architecture.
