# Logbook Processing Endpoint PRD

## Overview

This document defines the requirements, design, and implementation plan for the logbook processing endpoint in our FastAPI application. This endpoint is dedicated to initiating the asynchronous logbook ingestion workflow via FastAPI’s built-in BackgroundTasks. It is responsible for validating user payloads, securely handling credentials, and launching the multi-step processing orchestrator located in `services/logbook/orchestrator.py`. This PRD focuses solely on the processing endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/logbook/connect`) and does not cover real-time event streaming mechanisms such as SSE or WebSockets.

## Objectives and Scope

The main objectives for this endpoint are:

- **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload heavy I/O and computational operations (e.g., data acquisition, cleaning, CSV conversion, performance pyramid calculation, and persistence) to a background task using FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks.
- **Secure and Validated Input Handling:** Use established Pydantic models and dependency injection patterns (referenced from our Flask-to-FastAPI migration guidelines) to ensure that only valid data is processed. For Mountain Project, a valid `profile_url` must be provided; for 8a.nu ingestion, both `username` and `password` are required while `profile_url` must not be present.
- **Immediate Response with Task Identification:** Return an immediate acknowledgement containing a unique task identifier (or token) to the client, confirming that the logbook processing workflow has been initiated asynchronously.
- **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** Manage errors at every step using centralized exception handlers, ensuring that sensitive information is treated appropriately and that the processing stages are logged via structured logging.

This PRD focuses exclusively on the processing endpoint that triggers the ingestion and transformation workflow, excluding any considerations of the event-streaming endpoint.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Endpoint Specification**

   - **Route:** `POST /api/v1/logbook/connect`
   - **Purpose:** To initiate the logbook ingestion workflow.
   - **Payload:** Accepts a JSON payload that specifies the ingestion source:
     - For **Mountain Project** ingestion, provide a valid `profile_url`. Credentials must not be included.
     - For **8a.nu** ingestion, provide both `username` and `password`; ensure that `profile_url` is omitted.
   - **Validation:** Employ a Pydantic model (as described in our QNA document) with field validators and a root validator to enforce correct field dependencies and sanitize inputs. Sensitive data such as passwords must not be logged or persisted.

2. **Asynchronous Task Processing**

   - Utilize FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to offload the multi-step processing workflow. The background task will:
     - Fetch and clean raw logbook data.
     - Process CSV data and perform necessary transformations.
     - Calculate performance pyramids and build domain models (e.g., `UserTicks` and `PerformancePyramid`).
     - Commit the processed data to the database using asynchronous sessions.
   - The processing logic is encapsulated in `services/logbook/orchestrator.py`, which is invoked from the endpoint.

3. **Dependency Injection and Security**

   - The endpoint must utilize dependency injection to obtain:
     - Authentication/authorization middleware,
     - Database sessions (using async SQLAlchemy sessions),
     - Configuration and service-layer dependencies.
   - Ensure secure handling of credentials:
     - Credentials are used strictly for the current scraping or data retrieval session.
     - Sensitive fields are processed in-memory only and immediately cleared after use.
     - Avoid echoing sensitive data in logs by properly redacting or omitting them.

4. **Response Behavior**

   - Immediately return a JSON response upon receiving a valid request, with:
     - A unique **task identifier** that the client can use to correlate future events (if needed),
     - An HTTP status code of **202 Accepted** indicating that processing has been initiated.
   - The response does not include processing details; it simply acknowledges the initiation of the background workflow.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Integrate robust error handling throughout the endpoint and background task:
     - Use custom exceptions such as `AuthenticationError` and `DataSourceError` to capture failures.
     - Centralized exception handlers (as per our FastAPI logging and error handling design) should intercept and format errors without revealing sensitive internal details.
     - Structured logging must capture significant state changes and process milestones for monitoring and debugging, while ensuring that sensitive payload information is redacted.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The endpoint must return responses rapidly by offloading processing to background tasks; heavy operations must not block the main request-response cycle.
- **Scalability:** The asynchronous design and dependency injection should support high-concurrency scenarios with minimal overhead.
- **Maintainability:** The endpoint must adhere to clear separation of concerns; business logic resides in the orchestrator while the endpoint focuses solely on request validation, dependency injection, and task initiation.
- **Security:** Ensure that sensitive user data is strictly ephemeral, handled in-memory, and not stored or logged inadvertently.
- **Observability:** Implement comprehensive structured logging at key process checkpoints to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Environment Setup**

- Confirm all relevant asynchronous libraries and dependencies are installed and configured.
- Verify that Pydantic models **app_fastapi/schemas/logbook_connection.py** for payload validation are in place, and match patterns in other schemas.

**Step 2: Develop the Processing Endpoint**

- Create the `POST /api/v1/logbook/connect` endpoint.
- Integrate dependency injection for authentication, database sessions, and configuration.
- Validate the request payload using the predefined Pydantic model.
- On successful validation, immediately invoke the logbook orchestrator via FastAPI’s `BackgroundTasks`.
- Generate and return a unique task identifier in an HTTP 202 response.

**Step 3: Integrate with the Orchestrator**

- Ensure the endpoint properly calls the orchestrator in `services/logbook/orchestrator.py`.
- Confirm that the orchestration workflow (including data cleaning, CSV processing, performance calculation, and persistence) is executed asynchronously.

**Step 4: Error Handling and Logging**

- See logging and error handling in **app_fastapi/core/logging.py** and **app_fastapi/core/error_handlers.py** and **app_fastapi/core/exceptions.py**.
- Apply these patterns to the new endpoint.

**Step 5: Testing and Documentation**

- Develop unit and integration tests to verify:
  - Correct payload validation and sanitization,
  - Secure and ephemeral handling of credentials,
  - Successful initiation of the background task,
  - Proper error handling and logging.
- Update documentation to include endpoint usage, expected responses, and dependency details.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The endpoint validates and processes input according to the specified Pydantic schema.
- A background task is successfully initiated, offloading all heavy processing steps.
- An immediate, well-formed JSON response with a unique task identifier and HTTP 202 status is returned.
- Dependency injection is properly utilized to secure and manage external dependencies.
- Comprehensive structured logging captures all significant events without exposing sensitive data.
- Robust error handling ensures that failures in the background task are logged and managed gracefully.

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Error Propagation:** Background task failures must be managed to avoid leaving the client uninformed.  
  _Mitigation:_ Utilize central exception handlers and structured logging for transparency.
- **Credential Exposure:** Risk of inadvertently logging or persisting sensitive credentials.  
  _Mitigation:_ Enforce strict Pydantic validation and secure, transient handling of credentials.
- **Scalability Under High Concurrency:** Potential overload if background tasks are not efficiently managed.  
  _Mitigation:_ Monitor performance, ensure proper rate-limiting, and consider horizontal scaling if necessary.
