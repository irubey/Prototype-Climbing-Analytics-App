# Update Service Layer PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the process for modernizing our legacy **services** into a clean, scalable, and fully asynchronous service layer. The goal is to ensure that the updated service layer aligns with our new **FastAPI**-based architecture, thereby leveraging asynchronous paradigms, dependency injection, and improved error handling. This initiative will also retire redundant modules and consolidate logic to reflect only what is essential for the system moving forward.

## 1. Introduction and Rationale

Our legacy services were designed for a synchronous environment under the Flask framework. In migrating to FastAPI, we encountered substantial improvements in performance and scalability through asynchronous operations and explicit dependency injection. However, many of the legacy service files still contain outdated synchronous logic and redundant functionality that duplicates API endpoints. This PRD defines the process for auditing and updating these services so that they:

- Operate fully asynchronously,
- Integrate with FastAPI's dependency injection,
- Expose only the essential business logic required for future expansion, and
- Conform to modern coding practices aimed at maintainability and high throughput.

This update is essential to remove blocking calls, reduce complexity, and improve overall application performance, especially under high-concurrency and AI-driven scenarios.

## 2. Scope and Objectives

The update effort will include the following:

- Transition every service function to asynchronous execution using Python's async/await constructs.
- Retire any modules not essential to the forward path, particularly those that duplicate functionality already available in the API layer.
- Refactor services to integrate tightly with asynchronous database operations (e.g., SQLAlchemy AsyncSession).
- Enforce clear separation between low-level business logic and HTTP request handling by using FastAPI's dependency injection.
- Adopt a hybrid approach where lightweight operations are directly integrated while heavier operations are delegated to background tasks.

The objectives are to ensure that the updated services contribute to a highly performant, maintainable, and scalable application framework moving forward.

## 3. Functional Requirements

All legacy business logic should be evaluated and updated to adhere to the following:

- Every function that performs I/O-bound operations (such as database queries, external API calls, etc.) must be rewritten as an **async** function.
- Business logic previously encapsulated within decorators or middleware should be migrated into clear dependency functions or background tasks as appropriate.
- Code should be structured in a modular fashion with well-defined input/output interfaces that facilitate testing.
- The revised services must integrate seamlessly with the new FastAPI endpoints, promoting reuse and reducing code duplication.
- **Hybrid Asynchronous Strategy:** Lightweight, fast operations will be handled through FastAPI's dependency injection within the requestâ€“response cycle. In contrast, heavier operations that are either I/O-intensive or computationally heavy will be offloaded to background tasks to maintain responsive endpoints.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

The updated service layer must meet these non-functional requirements:

- **Performance:** The asynchronous service functions must minimize blocking, directly contributing to lower latency and increased throughput.
- **Maintainability:** The codebase should adopt clear dependency injection patterns, thorough inline documentation, and comprehensive unit tests.
- **Scalability:** The design will support high-concurrency workloads, particularly in scenarios involving rapid, simultaneous asynchronous operations.
- **Resilience:** Sufficient error handling and structured logging will be implemented to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## 5. Architecture and Design Decisions

The following architectural guidelines will be followed:

- **Asynchronous Operations:** Replace synchronous functions with async counterparts using Python's native async/await syntax. This includes transitioning to async database sessions and non-blocking I/O routines.
- **Dependency Injection:** Leverage FastAPI's dependency injection to inject necessary services or configurations directly into endpoint handlers, making dependencies explicit and testing more straightforward.
- **Hybrid Asynchronous Strategy:**
  - **Lightweight Operations:** Functions that perform quick, non-blocking operations will be integrated directly with endpoint handling via FastAPI's dependency injection. This provides clarity, maintains a simple call-chain, and leverages FastAPI's design principles.
  - **Heavy Operations:** Operations that involve significant I/O or intensive computation will be delegated to background processing tasks. Using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` or external task queues (e.g., Celery) ensures that long-running operations do not delay API responses. This separation allows for optimized resource use and improved endpoint responsiveness.
- **Consolidation vs. Retirement:** Evaluate existing services and consolidate overlapping functionalities, retiring redundant modules wherever possible.
- **Modularization:** Ensure that each service module is self-contained and adheres to single-responsibility principles to improve testability and code clarity.
- **Structured Logging and Error Handling:** Integrate logging and exception management strategies consistent with our new logging framework, ensuring that asynchronous flows are fully observable and debuggable.

## 6. Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Environment Setup**  
Establish a dedicated branch or repository for the service layer refactor. Confirm that all relevant asynchronous libraries (FastAPI, async drivers, etc.) are installed and correctly configured.

**Phase 2: File-by-File Legacy Service Review**  
Perform an audit of each file in the legacy services directory. During this phase, document the existing logic, identify redundant functionalities, and decide if a module should be updated or retired.  
_This section will be expanded with detailed per-file instructions as decisions are made._

**Phase 3: Asynchronous Refactoring**  
Convert the identified service functions to asynchronous equivalents. This includes:

- Rewriting synchronous I/O interactions (such as database calls) to use async libraries.
- Reorganizing business logic into clearly separated modules for dependency injection.
- Offloading heavy operations to background tasks to ensure a responsive API.
- Updating error handling to leverage FastAPI's exception handlers.

**Phase 4: Testing, Documentation, and Deployment**  
Develop thorough unit and integration tests to validate that the new asynchronous code meets performance and functionality expectations. Update documentation to reflect changes. Plan a phased deployment ensuring that the new service layer integrates smoothly with the API endpoints while allowing rollback if needed.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria and Rollback Plan

The service layer update will be considered successful if:

- All essential functions operate asynchronously with no synchronous blocking.
- Redundant or obsolete modules are successfully retired.
- Integration with FastAPI endpoints is seamless with rigorous testing evidence.
- The hybrid strategy effectively separates lightweight operations from heavy, background tasks.
- Performance benchmarks demonstrate improved response times and throughput.
- Comprehensive logging and error handling are in place.
- Detailed documentation is provided for future maintenance.

A rollback plan includes keeping a backup branch with the original legacy services and ensuring that API endpoints can revert to the prior functioning state if critical issues arise during transition.

## 8. Timeline

The project is projected to proceed in a phased manner, with initial setup and auditing scheduled for the first two weeks. Refactoring and testing are expected to take place over the following four weeks, with final verification and deployment occurring in a subsequent staging period. Specific dates will be assigned as the project plan is finalized.

## 9. Risk Management

Key risks include potential breakages in business logic when converting synchronous operations to asynchronous ones, unforeseen dependencies within legacy modules, and integration challenges with existing FastAPI endpoints. Mitigation strategies involve incremental refactoring, comprehensive testing, code reviews, and maintaining a fallback mechanism via a preserved legacy branch.

## 10. File-by-File Service Evaluation

_This section will be populated with detailed analysis and refactoring instructions for each legacy service file as decisions are made._

## 11. Future Enhancements

Once the update is complete, additional considerations such as deeper integration with background task processing, advanced monitoring, or further microservices-oriented refactoring may be undertaken. Future improvements will build upon the asynchronous, modular foundation established by this update.
