# Authentication Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to implementing and managing authentication in the system. It covers user registration, login, password management, and security best practices.

## User Registration
To register a new user, the following steps are required:

1. **Collect User Information**: Gather necessary details such as username, email, and password.
2. **Validate Input**: Ensure the provided data meets the system's requirements (e.g., password strength, valid email format).
3. **Hash Password**: Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to hash the password before storing it in the database.
4. **Store User Data**: Save the user's information in the database, ensuring sensitive data like passwords are securely stored.

## User Login
To authenticate a user during login:

1. **Retrieve User Data**: Fetch the user's data from the database using the provided username or email.
2. **Verify Password**: Compare the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database.
3. **Generate Session**: Create a session or token to maintain the user's authenticated state.

## Password Management
### Password Reset
1. **Request Reset**: User requests a password reset by providing their email.
2. **Generate Token**: Create a secure, time-limited token for the reset process.
3. **Send Email**: Send an email with a link containing the reset token.
4. **Reset Password**: Allow the user to set a new password after verifying the token.

### Password Update
1. **Verify Current Password**: Ensure the user knows their current password.
2. **Set New Password**: Hash and store the new password.

## Security Best Practices
1. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all authentication-related communication is encrypted.
2. **Strong Password Policies**: Enforce minimum password length, complexity, and regular updates.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
4. **Session Management**: Use secure, HttpOnly cookies for session management and implement session expiration.
5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Encourage or require MFA for added security.

## Conclusion
This documentation provides a foundation for implementing secure authentication in your system. Always stay updated with the latest security practices and regularly review your authentication mechanisms to ensure they remain robust against emerging threats.
